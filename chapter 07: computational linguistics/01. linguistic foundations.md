# Linguistic Foundations

- Syntax: phrase structure grammars, dependency grammar, constituency trees, context-free grammars
- Semantics: word meaning, compositionality, lexical relations (synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy), word sense disambiguation
- Pragmatics: context dependence, speech acts, implicature, discourse structure
- Morphology: stems, affixes, inflection vs derivation, morphological parsing
- Phonology and phonetics: phonemes, allophones, IPA, prosody (brief, as bridge to speech chapter)
