# Text Processing and Classic NLP

- Text normalisation: case folding, unicode handling, regex, edit distance (Levenshtein)
- Tokenisation: whitespace, rule-based, subword (BPE, WordPiece, Unigram, SentencePiece)
- Stemming vs lemmatisation
- POS tagging: rule-based, HMM taggers, Viterbi algorithm
- Named entity recognition: sequence labelling, BIO tagging
- Syntactic parsing: CYK algorithm, shift-reduce parsing, dependency parsing
- Bag-of-words, TF-IDF representations
- N-gram language models, perplexity, smoothing (Laplace, Kneser-Ney)
