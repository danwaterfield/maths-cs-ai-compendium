# Source Separation and Noise Cancellation

- Cocktail party problem: separating overlapping sources
- Classical methods: ICA, NMF, beamforming (delay-and-sum, MVDR)
- Deep learning methods: deep clustering, Conv-TasNet, DPRNN, SepFormer
- Permutation invariant training (PIT)
- Music source separation: Demucs, Open-Unmix
- Active noise cancellation (ANC): feedforward vs feedback, adaptive filtering (LMS, NLMS)
- Noise reduction and speech enhancement: spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, neural speech enhancement
- Echo cancellation: acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), double-talk detection
