# Digital Signal Processing

- Sound as a signal: waveforms, amplitude, frequency, phase
- Sampling: Nyquist theorem, sample rate, aliasing, quantisation
- Time-domain analysis: energy, zero-crossing rate, autocorrelation
- Frequency-domain analysis: DFT, FFT, spectrograms, mel scale
- Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs): derivation and intuition
- Filtering: FIR and IIR filters, bandpass, low-pass, high-pass
- Windowing: Hamming, Hanning, rectangular, overlap-add
- Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and time-frequency tradeoff
