# Space and Extreme Robotics

- Space robotics: orbital servicing, planetary rovers (Mars rover autonomy), satellite inspection
- Communication constraints: high latency, limited bandwidth, onboard autonomy
- Radiation-hardened computing: constraints on hardware, model compression for space
- Autonomous navigation in unstructured terrain: visual-inertial odometry, hazard avoidance
- Underwater robotics: AUVs, ROVs, acoustic communication, SLAM in low-visibility
- Search and rescue robotics: disaster response, multi-robot coordination
- Swarm robotics: decentralised control, emergent behaviour, consensus algorithms
- Human-robot interaction: shared autonomy, teleoperation, trust calibration
