# Self-Driving Cars

- Autonomous driving stack: perception → prediction → planning → control
- HD maps vs mapless driving: pre-built maps, online map construction
- Motion prediction: trajectory forecasting, social forces, graph neural networks for agent interaction
- Planning: rule-based planners, optimisation-based (trajectory optimisation), learning-based (neural planners)
- End-to-end driving: UniAD, from sensor inputs directly to control outputs
- Simulation: CARLA, nuPlan, closed-loop vs open-loop evaluation
- Safety: functional safety (ISO 26262), SOTIF, operational design domain (ODD)
- Levels of autonomy: SAE L1–L5, current industry state
