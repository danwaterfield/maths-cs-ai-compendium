# Robot Learning

- Robot kinematics: forward and inverse kinematics, DH parameters, joint spaces
- Dynamics and control: PID control, model predictive control (MPC), impedance control
- Imitation learning: behavioural cloning, DAgger, learning from demonstrations
- Sim-to-real transfer: domain randomisation, system identification, reality gap
- Reward shaping and curriculum learning for robotics
- Manipulation: grasping (analytical, data-driven), dexterous manipulation, contact-rich tasks
- Locomotion: legged robots, quadrupeds, humanoid balance, CPG-based control
- Safety: safe exploration, constrained RL, risk-aware planning
