# Large Scale Infrastructure

- Scalability: vertical vs horizontal scaling, stateless services
- Distributed systems: consensus (Paxos, Raft), leader election, distributed locks
- Microservices: service decomposition, API contracts, service discovery, saga pattern
- Data pipelines: batch processing (MapReduce, Spark), stream processing (Flink, Kafka Streams)
- Database scaling: read replicas, partitioning strategies (range, hash, directory), cross-shard queries
- Search systems: inverted indices, Elasticsearch, vector search (FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone)
- Observability: logging (ELK), metrics (Prometheus, Grafana), tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)
- Reliability: SLOs, SLIs, SLAs, error budgets, chaos engineering
- CI/CD: build pipelines, blue-green deployments, canary releases, feature flags
