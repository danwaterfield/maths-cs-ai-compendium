# Graphs

- Representations: adjacency matrix, adjacency list, edge list, incidence matrix
- Traversals: BFS (shortest path in unweighted graphs), DFS (cycle detection, topological sort)
- Shortest paths: Dijkstra (non-negative weights), Bellman-Ford (negative weights, cycle detection), Floyd-Warshall (all pairs)
- Minimum spanning trees: Kruskal (union-find), Prim (priority queue)
- Topological sort: Kahn's algorithm (BFS), DFS-based
- Strongly connected components: Tarjan's algorithm, Kosaraju's algorithm
- Network flow: Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp, max-flow min-cut theorem
- Bipartite matching: Hungarian algorithm, Hopcroft-Karp
