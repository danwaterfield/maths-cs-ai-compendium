# Arrays and Hashing

- Arrays: contiguous memory, indexing, dynamic arrays (amortised doubling), cache locality
- Strings: encoding (ASCII, UTF-8), string matching (KMP, Rabin-Karp, Boyer-Moore)
- Hash tables: hash functions, collision resolution (chaining, open addressing, linear probing, robin hood hashing)
- Hash maps and hash sets: average vs worst-case complexity, load factor, rehashing
- Bloom filters: probabilistic membership, false positive rate, applications
- Two pointers technique, sliding window
- Prefix sums and difference arrays
