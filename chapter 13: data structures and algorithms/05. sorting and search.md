# Sorting and Search

- Comparison sorts: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort (pivot strategies, Hoare vs Lomuto partition), heapsort
- Lower bound for comparison sorting: O(n log n) via decision trees
- Non-comparison sorts: counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort
- Binary search: standard, lower/upper bound, search on answer (monotonic functions)
- Divide and conquer: master theorem, merge sort analysis, closest pair of points
- Greedy algorithms: activity selection, Huffman coding, interval scheduling
- Dynamic programming: overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure, memoisation vs tabulation, classic problems (knapsack, LCS, edit distance, coin change)
- Backtracking: N-queens, Sudoku, constraint satisfaction
